## <a name="issue"></a> Creating an Issue

If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't
already been reported. You can search through existing issues to see if there is a similar one reported. Include closed
issues as it may have been closed with a solution.

If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work
first, to be sure that we can use it.

## <a name="pull-request"></a> Creating a Pull Request

Before submitting a pull request, we ask that you please create an issue that explains the bug or feature request and
let us know that you plan on creating a pull request for it. If an issue already exists, please comment on that issue
letting us know you would like to submit a pull request for it. This helps us to keep track of the pull request and
make sure there isn't duplicated effort.

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

Each commit message should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) standard.
